##Medical Cost Analysis  
-Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance
-In this project, you will be trying to develop an end-to-end data science application using the
dataset given above. The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's
health insurance based on the given variables. While creating the project, try to follow the
instructions below and make sure that the project is unique.
-1. Creating a Google Colaboratory File
*● Make sure your project has .ipynb extension.
*● Make sure that there are comment lines explaining the details in your project.
*● When submitting the project, submit the cells of this .ipynb file so that the cells are
run and the results are visible.  
-2. Importing Required Libraries  
*● Import the required libraries for the project to the Colab environment.
*● Import Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Sklearn libraries for data analysis
-3. Perform An Exploratory Data Analysis
*● Analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
*○ Examine the distribution of Bmi (Body Mass Index)
*○ Examine the relationship between “smoker” and “charges”
*○ Examine the relationship between “smoker” and “region”.
*○ Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “sex”.
*○ Find the "region" with the most "children".
*○ Examine the relationship between “age” and “bmi”.
*○ Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “children”.
*○ Is there an outlier in the "bmi" variable? Please review.
*○ Examine the relationship between “bmi” and “charges”.
*○ Examine the relationship between “region”, “smoker” and “bmi” using bar plot.
*● Try to use data visualization techniques as much as possible while examining the
data.
*● Please add the meanings you deduced from the analyzes as a comment line.
-4. Data Preprocessing
*● In this section, prepare the data you have, for training the model.
*● Use Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding techniques to deal with categorical
variables.
*● Split your dataset into X_train,X_test, y_train, y_test.
*● Scale the dataset by normalizing it(Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling).
-5. Model Selection
*● Select several regression models and train them with the preprocessed data.
*● Examine the performances of the selected models using cross validation.
*● Choose the best performing model
-6. Hyper-parameter Optimization
*● Optimize the hyper-parameters of the model selected in the previous step.
*● Optimize parameters with Grid Search. (Grid Search or Randomized Search)
-7. Model Evaluation
*● Evaluate the optimized model using regression model evaluation metrics. (Ex. Mean
Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error etc.)
